    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-2">Understanding the Fitness Revolution</h2>
    <p class="text-white mb-4">
        The Fitness Revolution signifies a shift in how we perceive health and exercise. It’s about breaking down barriers, 
        debunking myths, and recognizing that fitness is for everyone. Gone are the days when fitness was solely associated 
        with bodybuilders or elite athletes. Today, it’s a celebration of diversity in body types, fitness levels, and personal goals.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-2">Get Fit: The Benefits of Exercise</h2>
    <p class="text-white mb-4">
        Getting fit is not just a goal; it’s a journey filled with numerous benefits. Regular physical activity can improve 
        cardiovascular health, enhance muscular strength, boost metabolism, and increase overall energy levels.
    </p>
    <p class="text-white mb-4">
        Moreover, exercise is a powerful tool for mental health. Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins—often 
        referred to as "feel-good" hormones—that elevate mood and reduce feelings of stress and anxiety.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-2">Stay Strong: Building Resilience</h2>
    <p class="text-white mb-4">
        Staying strong goes beyond physical strength; it encompasses mental resilience and emotional well-being. The 
        Fitness Revolution emphasizes the importance of developing a strong mindset. Life is full of challenges, and 
        cultivating resilience can help you navigate setbacks in both fitness and daily life.
